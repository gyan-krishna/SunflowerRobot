## Components Needed:-
  > Arduino Nano - x1
  
  > Light Dependent Resistor - 4x
  
  > 10K Ohm Resisto - 4x
  
  > 9g Servo motor - 2x
  
  > Bread Board/perf board - 1x

## Instructions:-
  Build the circuit as shown below, and upload the sketch
  Calibration of sensors:- 
      LDR sensors may not give the same output voltage at the same time due to manufacturing issues,
      So, run the program without the motors connected and with light directly shined at the flower
